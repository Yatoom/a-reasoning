\section*{Problem 2}

Give a chip design containing three power components and eight regular components satisfying the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The width of the chip is 29 and the height is 22.
  \item All power components have width 4 and height 2.
  \item The sizes of the eight regular components are $9 \times 7$, $12 \times 6$, $10 \times 7$, $18 \times 5$, $20 \times 4$, $10 \times 6$, $8 \times 6$ and $10 \times 8$, respectively.
  \item All components may be turned 90, but may not overlap.
  \item In order to get power, all regular components should directly be connected to a power component, that is, an edge of the component should have at least one point in common with an edge of the power component.
  \item Due to limits on heat production the power components should be not too close: their centres should differ at least 17 in either the $x$ direction or the $y$ direction (or both).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution:}
First of all, we generalize this problem for any width $S_1$ and height $S_2$ of the chip and for any number $p$ and $r$ of power and regular components respectively. Assume the chip plan is a positive plane whose left-bottom corner has coordinate $(0, 0)$, then the right-top corner has coordinate $(S_1, S_2)$.
Next, we introduce $2 \times p$ coordinates of the form $(x_{ik}, y_{ik})$ for $i = 1, 2 , ... , p$ and $k = 1, 2$, to represent the corners of each power component. Hence, power component $i$ has coordinates $(x_{i1}, y_{i1})$, $(x_{i2}, y_{i1})$, $(x_{i1}, y_{i2})$ and $(x_{i2}, y_{i2})$.

Similarly, we introduce $2 \times r$ coordinates of the form $(n_{jk}, m_{jk})$ for $j = 1, 2 , ... , r$ and $k = 1, 2$, to represent the corners of each regular component.

Now, we give formulas that translates the constraints in terms of this variables.

\begin{description}
  \item[Constraint 1:] The chip is a positive plane, so all the coordinates should be positive. Additionally, the width of the chip is $S_1$ and the height is $S_2$.

  Then we have
  \[  \bigwedge_{i=1}^p S_1 \geq x_{i2} \geq x_{i1} \geq 0 \wedge S_2 \geq y_{i2} \geq y_{i1} \geq 0 \;\; \wedge \]
  \[  \bigwedge_{i=1}^r S_1 \geq n_{i2} \geq n_{i1} \geq 0 \wedge S_2 \geq m_{i2} \geq m_{i1} \geq 0 \]
  

  \item[Constraint 2:] All coordinates of a given component have to respect its respective size, also a component may be turned 90. To formulate this, we define $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ as the height and width of all power components, and $H_{j}$ and $W_{j}$ as the height and width of regular component $j$.

  Then we have the following formula for power components:
  \[  \bigwedge_{i=1}^p ((x_{i2} - x_{i1} = Z_1 \; \wedge \; y_{i2} - y_{i1} = Z_2) \;\; \vee \]
  \[ (x_{i2} - x_{i1} = Z_2 \; \wedge \; y_{i2} - y_{i1} = Z_1)) \]

  Similarly, the formula for regular components is:
  \[  \bigwedge_{j=1}^r (n_{j2} - n_{j1} = W_j \; \wedge \; m_{j2} - m_{j1} = H_j) \;\; \vee (n_{j2} - n_{j1} = H_j \; \wedge \; m_{j2} - m_{j1} = W_j) \]
  
  
  \item[Constraint 3:] All components may not overlap.

\begin{center}

\end{center}
  As the figure shows, only if a component's $x_{i1}$ is larger than the other one's $x_{k2}$, then these two components are not overlapped. We also have the case in the $y$ direction. Hence the formulas that express the two components may not overlap are the following.

  Among the power components:

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,l: 1 \leq i < l \leq p}
  x_{i2} \leq x_{l1} \; \vee \; x_{l2} \leq x_{i1} \; \vee \; y_{i2} \leq y_{l1} \; \vee \; y_{l2} \leq y_{i1} \]

  Among the regular components:

  \[  \bigwedge_{j,l: 1 \leq j < l \leq r}
  n_{j2} \leq n_{l1} \; \vee \; n_{l2} \leq n_{j1} \; \vee \; m_{j2} \leq m_{l1} \; \vee \; m_{l2} \leq m_{j1}  \]

  Between the power components and the regular components:

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i \leq p, 1 \leq j \leq r}
   x_{i2} \leq n_{j1} \; \vee \; n_{j2} \leq x_{i1} \; \vee \; y_{i2} \leq m_{j1} \; \vee \; m_{j2} \leq y_{i1} \]

  \item[Constraint 4:] An edge of the regular component should have at least one point in common with an edge of the power component.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Part1_2_2.png}
\end{center}

  As the figure above shows, if two components are touched at least by one point, then at least one coordinate of a component is the same as the other one. Based in this observation, we can state that when the $x$ coordinate of two components are the same, and also the $y$'s coordinate of one is bound by the $y$'s coordinates of the other component, we can conclude that they are touching. The same holds when they share a $y$'s coordinate. We denote this condition as follows.

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i \leq p, 1 \leq k \leq r}
  ((x_{i2} = n_{k1} \; \vee \; x_{i1} = n_{k2}) \; \wedge \;
  (y_{i2} \geq m_{k1} \wedge m_{k2} \geq y_{i1}) \; \vee \; \]
  \[  ((y_{i2} = m_{k1} \; \vee \; y_{i1} = m_{k2}) \; \wedge \;
  (x_{i2} \geq n_{k1} \wedge n_{k2} \geq x_{i1}))) \]
  
  \item[Constraint 5:] The power components' centres should differ at least 17 in either the $x$ direction or the $y$ direction (or both).

  The centers of the power components are $(x_{i1} + \frac{x_{i2} - x_{i1}}{2}, y_{i1} + \frac{y_{i2} - y_{i1}}{2} )$.

  For each pair of the power components, we have

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i < k \leq p}
  [ (x_{i1} + \frac{x_{i2} - x_{i1}}{2}) - (x_{k1} + \frac{x_{k2} - x_{k1}}{2}) \geq 17 \; \vee \; \]
  \[ (x_{k1} + \frac{x_{k2} - x_{k1}}{2}) - (x_{i1} + \frac{x_{i2} - x_{i1}}{2}) \geq 17 \; \vee \; \]
  \[ (y_{k1} + \frac{y_{k2} - y_{k1}}{2}) - (y_{i1} + \frac{y_{i2} - y_{i1}}{2}) \geq 17 \; \vee \; \]
  \[ (y_{i1} + \frac{y_{i2} - y_{i1}}{2}) - (y_{k1} + \frac{y_{k2} - y_{k1}}{2}) \geq 17 ] \]


\end{description}

The total formula now consists of the conjunction of all these clauses. To solve this particular problem, we made the Yices smt code considering the number of power components $p=3$, the number of regular components $r=8$, and replacing the parameters $S_1$, $S_2$, $Z_1$, $Z_2$, $H_j$ and $W_j$ with its respective values of height and width as specified by the problem.
