\section*{Problem 2}

Give a chip design containing three power components and eight regular components satisfying the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The width of the chip is 29 and the height is 22.
  \item All power components have width 4 and height 2.
  \item The sizes of the eight regular components are $9 \times 7$, $12 \times 6$, $10 \times 7$, $18 \times 5$, $20 \times 4$, $10 \times 6$, $8 \times 6$ and $10 \times 8$, respectively.
  \item All components may be turned 90, but may not overlap.
  \item In order to get power, all regular components should directly be connected to a power component, that is, an edge of the component should have at least one point in common with an edge of the power component.
  \item Due to limits on heat production the power components should be not too close: their centres should differ at least 17 in either the $x$ direction or the $y$ direction (or both).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution:}
First of all, we assume the chip plan is a positive plane whose left-bottom corner has coordinate $(0, 0)$, and right-top corner has coordinate $(29, 22)$.
Next, we introduce coordinates to each corner of each components $(x_{ij}, y_{ij})$ to specify them.
See below.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For the three power components:\\
  Power component 1 has coordinates $(x_{11}, y_{11})$, $(x_{12}, y_{11})$, $(x_{12}, y_{11})$ and $(x_{12}, y_{12})$.\\
  Power component 2 has coordinates $(x_{21}, y_{21})$, $(x_{22}, y_{21})$, $(x_{22}, y_{21})$ and $(x_{22}, y_{22})$.\\
  Power component 3 has coordinates $(x_{31}, y_{31})$, $(x_{32}, y_{31})$, $(x_{32}, y_{31})$ and $(x_{32}, y_{32})$.
  \item For the eight regular components:\\
  Regular component 1 has coordinates $(n_{11}, m_{11})$, $(n_{12}, m_{11})$, $(n_{12}, m_{11})$ and $(n_{12}, m_{12})$.\\
  Regular component 2 has coordinates $(n_{21}, m_{21})$, $(n_{22}, m_{21})$, $(n_{22}, m_{21})$ and $(n_{22}, m_{22})$.

  $\cdots \cdots$

  Regular component 8 has coordinates $(n_{81}, m_{81})$, $(n_{82}, m_{81})$, $(n_{82}, m_{81})$ and $(n_{82}, m_{82})$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, we plan to put the components onto the plan in terms of the constraints.

\begin{description}
  \item[Constraint 1:] Now the chip is a positive plane, so all the coordinates should be positive. The width of the chip is 29 and the height is 22.

  Then we have
  \[  \bigwedge_{i=1}^3 29 \geq x_{i2} \geq x_{i1} \geq 0 \wedge 22 \geq y_{i2} \geq y_{i1} \geq 0 \;\; \wedge \]
  \[  \bigwedge_{i=1}^8 29 \geq n_{i2} \geq n_{i1} \geq 0 \wedge 22 \geq m_{i2} \geq m_{i1} \geq 0 \]
  \item[Constraint 2:] All power components have width 4 and height 2,
  and the sizes of the eight regular components are $9 \times 7$, $12 \times 6$, $10 \times 7$, $18 \times 5$, $20 \times 4$, $10 \times 6$, $8 \times 6$ and $10 \times 8$, respectively.
  All components may be turned 90.

  Then we have
  \[  \bigwedge_{i=1}^3 ((x_{i2} - x_{i1} = 4 \; \wedge \; y_{i2} - y_{i1} = 2) \;\; \vee \]
  \[ (x_{i2} - x_{i1} = 2 \; \wedge \; y_{i2} - y_{i1} = 4)) \]
  So do the coordinates for the Regular components. However their sizes are distinct,
  this makes more writing and coding. Here we only show the clause for the first regular component,
  whose size is $9 \times 7$. \\
  \[ (n_{12} - n_{11} = 9 \; \wedge \; m_{12} - m_{11} = 7) \;\; \vee (n_{12} - n_{11} = 7 \; \wedge \; m_{12} - m_{11} = 9) \]
  \item[Constraint 3:] All components may not overlap.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Part1_2_1.png}
\end{center}
  As the figure shows, only if a component's $x_{i1}$ is larger than the other one's $x_{k2}$, then these two components are not overlapped. We also have the case in the y direction.

  Among the power components:

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i \leq 3, 1 \leq k \leq 3, i \neq k}
  x_{i2} \leq x_{k1} \; \vee \; x_{k2} \leq x_{i1} \; \vee \; y_{i2} \leq y_{k1} \; \vee \; y_{k2} \leq y_{i1} \]

  Among the regular components:

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i \leq 8, 1 \leq k \leq 8, i \neq k}
  n_{i2} \leq n_{k1} \; \vee \; n_{k2} \leq n_{i1} \; \vee \; m_{i2} \leq m_{k1} \; \vee \; m_{k2} \leq m_{i1}  \]

  Between the power components and the regular components:

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i \leq 3, 1 \leq k \leq 8, i \neq k}
   x_{i2} \leq n_{k1} \; \vee \; n_{k2} \leq x_{i1} \; \vee \; y_{i2} \leq m_{k1} \; \vee \; m_{k2} \leq y_{i1} \]

  \item[Constraint 4:] An edge of the regular component should have at least one point in common with an edge of the power component.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Part1_2_2.png}
\end{center}

  As the figure above shows, if two components are touched at least one point, then at least one coordinate of a component is the same as the other one. We consider it from the inverse way to make the clauses simpler. If two components have the same $x_{i1}$ value, only if their $y$-direction sides are not touched, then these two components are not in common with an edge of each other.
  We denote this condition as follows.

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i \leq 3, 1 \leq k \leq 8}
  ((x_{i2} = n_{k1} \; \vee \; x_{i1} = n_{k2}) \; \wedge \;
  \neg (y_{i2} < m_{k1} \vee m_{k2} < y_{i1}) \; \vee \; \]
  \[  ((y_{i2} = m_{k1} \; \vee \; y_{i1} = m_{k2}) \; \wedge \;
  \neg (x_{i2} < n_{k1} \vee n_{k2} < x_{i1}))) \]
  \item[Constraint 5:] The power components' centres should differ at least 17 in either the $x$ direction or the $y$ direction (or both).

  The centers of the power components are $(x_{i1} + \frac{x_{i2} - x_{i1}}{2}, y_{i1} + \frac{y_{i2} - y_{i1}}{2} )$.

  For each pair of the power components, we have

  \[  \bigwedge_{i,k: 1 \leq i < k \leq 3}
  [ (x_{i1} + \frac{x_{i2} - x_{i1}}{2}) - (x_{k1} + \frac{x_{k2} - x_{k1}}{2}) \geq 17 \; \vee \; \]
  \[ (x_{k1} + \frac{x_{k2} - x_{k1}}{2}) - (x_{i1} + \frac{x_{i2} - x_{i1}}{2}) \geq 17 \; \vee \; \]
  \[ (y_{k1} + \frac{y_{k2} - y_{k1}}{2}) - (y_{i1} + \frac{y_{i2} - y_{i1}}{2}) \geq 17 \; \vee \; \]
  \[ (y_{i1} + \frac{y_{i2} - y_{i1}}{2}) - (y_{k1} + \frac{y_{k2} - y_{k1}}{2}) \geq 17 ] \]


\end{description}

Making a conjunction of all the clauses derived from the constraints, we made the Yices smt cods.

This formula is easily expressed in SMT syntax.
