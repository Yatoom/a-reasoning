\section*{Problem 3}

The goal of this problem is to exploit the power of the recommended tools rather than elaborating the questions by hand

\begin{description}
  \item[(a)] In mathematics, a \emph{group} is defined to be a set $G$ with an element $I \epsilon G$, a binary operator $\ast$ and a unary operator \emph{inv} satisfying
      \begin{center}
      $ x \ast(y \ast z)=(x\ast y) \ast z, x \ast I = x $ and $ x \ast inv(x) = I, $
      \end{center}
      for all $x, y, z \epsilon G$. Determine whether in every group each of the four properties
      \begin{center}
      $I \ast x = x, inv(inv(x)) = x, inv(x) \ast x = I $ and $ x \ast y = y \ast x $
      \end{center}
      holds for all $x, y \epsilon G$. If a property does not hold, determine the size of the smallest finite group for which it does not hold.
  \item[(b)] A term rewrite system consists of the single rule
  \[ a(x, a(y, a(z, u))) \rightarrow a(y, a(z, a(x, u)))), \]

  in which a is a binary symbol and $x, y, z, u$ are variables. Moreover, there are constants $b, c, d, e, f, g$. Determine whether $c$ and $d$ may be swapped in $a(b, a(c, a(d, a(e, a(f, a(b, g))))))$ by rewriting, that is, a(b, a(c, a(d, a(e, a(f, a(b, g)))))) rewrites in a finite number of steps to $a(b, a(d, a(c, a(e, a(f, a(b, g))))))$.

\subsection*{Solution:}

\begin{description}
  \item[(a)] In this problem, three assumptions are given. So we use $Prover9$ to prove the four properties. The codes are as follows. Here we denote \emph{inv(x)} as $x'$ for the sake of simplicity.

  After applying {\tt prover9 -f part2\_3a.in}, we found that the first 3 properties are proved, but the fourth one is failed. In order to determine the size of the smallest finite group for which it does not hold, we apply {\tt mace4 part$2\_3a$.in} to find the smallest noncommutative group by finding the conterexample to the statement that all groups are commutative. {\tt mace4} exits with 1 model below.

Therefore, {\tt mace4} determines that the size of the smallest finite group, for which $ x \ast y = y \ast x $ does not hold, is 6.

  \item[(b)] To determine the possibility of the rewriting in a finite number of steps, we use $mace4$ to find a smallest number of swapping steps by finding the conterexample to the statement that $c$ and $d$ may not swap.

  This problem gives only a single rule.  Then the first step is to fulfill the assumptions with some closed terms rewriting according to the slide handout, page267. They are

      \[ R(a(x, u), a(u, x)). \]
      \[ R(x, y) \rightarrow R(a(x, z), a(y, z)). \]
      \[ R(x, y) \rightarrow R(a(z, x), a(z, y)).\]

      Then the final $mace4$ codes are

{\footnotesize

{\tt formulas(assumptions).}

{\tt R(a(x, u), a(u, x)).}

{\tt R(x, y) -> R(a(x, z), a(y, z)).}

{\tt R(x, y) -> R(a(z, x), a(z, y)).}

{\tt \% the given single rule}

{\tt RR(a(x, a(y, a(z, u))), a(y, a(z, a(x, u)))).}

{\tt end\_of\_list.}

{\tt formulas(goals).}

{\tt RR(a(b, a(c, a(d, a(e, a(f, a(b, g)))))), a(b, a(d, a(c, a(e, a(f, a(b, g))))))).}

{\tt end\_of\_list.  }

  }

  After running $mace4$, we found that the smallest number of swapping steps is 3. So $c$ and $d$ can be swapped in $a(b, a(c, a(d, a(e, a(f, a(b, g))))))$ by rewriting in 3 steps to $a(b, a(d, a(c, a(e, a(f, a(b, g))))))$.
